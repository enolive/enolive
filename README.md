Software Crafter, currently employed at DATEV e.G.

## What I strongly believe in

- If there is evil in this world, it lurks in the hearts of men
- 3 hours of meetings saves you 15 minutes of implementation time
- while it is unlikely that there are any silver bullets in dev, Mob/Ensemble Programming might be one
- while it is possible to save time XOR money XOR resources on a project, producing deliberately cruft by skipping tests/code quality/whatever will never work
- there is no reason not to push an early, simple prototype to production in a couple of weeks
- discussions that cannot be solved within 15 minutes can't be solved at all due to a lack of knowledge/bad arguments
- when arguing with others, always assume you are wrong
- human communication usually fails, except by accident
- the choice of technology is of minor importance, even for horrible ones such as Java+Angular
- that said, the best programming language in the world is surely Haskell ðŸ˜‰
